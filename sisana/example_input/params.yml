##### We will start this example file by reconstructing networks for just 20 samples from the TCGA dataset (10 LumA, 10 LumB).
##### After reconstructing the networks (Stage 2), we will use a larger dataset with more LumA and LumB samples. This is just 
##### to cut down on the length of computational time for this tutorial.
#######################################################################################################################################

# Stage 1: Preprocess data to format for next stage
# example: sisana preprocess params.yml
preprocess:
  exp_file: ./example_inputs/BRCA_TCGA_20_LumA_LumB_samps_5000_genes_exp.tsv # Path to expression file, which MUST CONTAIN A HEADER
  motif_file: ./example_inputs/motif_tcga_brca.tsv # path to motif file
  ppi_file: ./example_inputs/ppi_tcga_brca.tsv # path to PPI file
  number: 5 # number of samples a gene must be expressed in
  outdir: ./output/preprocess # The directory to save the output to

# Stage 2: Reconstruct networks and calculate degrees
# example: sisana generate params.yml
generate:
  method: lioness # Which method to use, either "panda" to run just PANDA or "lioness", which runs PANDA first, then LIONESS
  processed_paths: ./tmp/processed_data_paths.yml # Path to yaml file containing the location of the processed data files. By default, these files are stored to ./tmp/processed_data_paths.yml
  pandafilepath: ./output/network/panda_network.txt # Path to the panda output file to be created. Must have a .txt extension.

  # The following commands are used if you specified "lioness" for the method arg
  compute: cpu # Whether to use "gpu" or "cpu" for computing LIONESS networks
  ncores: 20 # Number of cores to use for calculating LIONESS networks. Must be less than or equal to the number of samples
  lionessfilepath: ./output/network/lioness_networks.npy # Path to the lioness output file to be created. Must have a .npy extension.

#######################################################################################################################################
##### Note: Now we will begin running the downstream analysis on a superset of the samples used for stages 1 and 2. This superset
##### contains 100 LumA samples and 100 LumB samples, all from the TCGA dataset. This is to save on computational time for this
##### tutorial. For your data, you will continue using the files produced by stage 1 and stage 2 in your analysis.
